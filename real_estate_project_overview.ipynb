        "### Background\n",
        "Real estate has many opportunities in which to apply data science methods.  I want to develop a model that will allow for identification of pricing assymetries in the real estate market by being able to accurately price assets and there by identify opportunities when new properties are discovered. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Project Description\n",
        "My goal is to develop a model that can detect \"good prices\" in real estate markets of my choosing in order to identify deals.  Maybe I will buy one of these properties someday!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Metric + Analyses\n",
        "1. *Pricing Accuracy* - can the model learn what a good price is and make a price prediction for a specific property?  This would involve predicting the price at which a property will sell based on a variety of features, and can be verified in training data by comparing the prediction with the actual sale price.  RMSE comes to mind as a possible measure of model accuracy. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. *Value Drivers* - which attributions associated with a property influence price and do those factors change based on geography?  Obvious things like square-foot (size) of property will matter, but there are likely other discoverable features here that provide a rich opportunity for feature engineering.  Normalizing for macro-economic trends may also be an option, since housing prices are defined inside a marketplace that is influenced by factors like: mortgage rates, inflation, GDP, etc... \n",
        "\n",
        "3. *Similar markets* - Which markets are complementary in the sense that they have similar attributes and properties represent a similar value to purchasers?  Identifying a similarity metric for markets would allow this analysis to encompass greater quantities of data.  Presumably, data from similar markets could be combined to make predictions while dissimilar ones should be excluded.  As an example, California beachfront property or NYC apartments are likely not comparable to a single family home in the midwest and we would not want to train data using Cali/NYC data if we want to predict home prices in rural Kansas."
